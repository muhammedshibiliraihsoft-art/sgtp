# Changelog

## 2026-09-27

- Completed PRE-P3-02 documentation-only governance correction.
- Locked the V1 model as exactly one Main Supplier / Main Admin above multiple isolated Shops.
- Clarified that External Suppliers are Shop-owned non-user records with no login, tenant role, or global/shared directory.
- Hardened the Phase 3 T3-01 brief and preserved the legacy Tenant compatibility decision gate.
- No Phase 3 business implementation, models, migrations, APIs, or application source changes were made.

## 2026-09-25

- Bootstrapped repository continuity documentation and agent instructions.
- Recorded the verified baseline: empty Git repository with no Django implementation.
- Established the SGTP V1 Target Final Product / Definition of Done, including the supplier/shop hierarchy, Tailor Management workflow, technical capabilities, boundaries, and end-to-end validation requirements.
- Realigned the architecture, development plan, project state, handoff, and agent instructions to the approved target without changing application code.
- Clarified the project-wide confirmation gate: phase confirmation activates scope only; each task requires a separate explicit task confirmation and ends with a stop boundary.
- Added the missing Phase 7–10 Antigravity implementation playbooks without changing the approved architecture, scope, order, or implementation decisions.
- Canonicalized target implementation paths, domain boundaries, deployment direction, and refresh-token handling across the phase plan while preserving current-starter descriptions.
- Documented the required CSRF strategy decision point for cookie-based refresh; the concrete mechanism remains a Phase 2 selection, implementation, and validation task.
- Corrected project state to distinguish the existing starter foundation from unimplemented Phase 1 work; recorded Phase 1 as independently audited and ready, but inactive and unconfirmed.
- Recorded approved URL-path tenant context (`/shops/{shop_id}/...`) and Primary Client ownership for Related Person billing; retained Phase 2 CSRF mechanism selection and validation as an explicit task.

## 2026-09-27

- Added the dependency-light `scripts/verify_project_state.py` validator, focused validator tests, and a GitHub Actions state-validation gate.
- Added an evidence-backed repository-state completion rule to `AGENTS.md` and synchronized current Phase 2/B2-05, 47-test, and Phase 3-not-started documentation claims.
- Activated Phase 1 and completed Task F1-01 (Repository and dependency baseline). Established virtual environment and verified manage.py check. Documented validation limitations: existing starter lint violations remain and pytest is blocked by unavailable PostgreSQL; no application source cleanup was performed.
- Completed Task F1-02 (Environment management and settings split) by modularizing core/settings.py into ackend/config/settings/{base,dev,prod,test}.py, updating .env.example, and ensuring safe failure on missing secrets.
