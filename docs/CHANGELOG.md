# Changelog

## 2026-09-25

- Bootstrapped repository continuity documentation and agent instructions.
- Recorded the verified baseline: empty Git repository with no Django implementation.
- Established the SGTP V1 Target Final Product / Definition of Done, including the supplier/shop hierarchy, Tailor Management workflow, technical capabilities, boundaries, and end-to-end validation requirements.
- Realigned the architecture, development plan, project state, handoff, and agent instructions to the approved target without changing application code.
- Clarified the project-wide confirmation gate: phase confirmation activates scope only; each task requires a separate explicit task confirmation and ends with a stop boundary.
- Added the missing Phase 7–10 Antigravity implementation playbooks without changing the approved architecture, scope, order, or implementation decisions.
- Canonicalized target implementation paths, domain boundaries, deployment direction, and refresh-token handling across the phase plan while preserving current-starter descriptions.
- Documented the required CSRF strategy decision point for cookie-based refresh; the concrete mechanism remains a Phase 2 selection, implementation, and validation task.
- Corrected project state to distinguish the existing starter foundation from unimplemented Phase 1 work; recorded Phase 1 as independently audited and ready, but inactive and unconfirmed.
- Recorded approved URL-path tenant context (`/shops/{shop_id}/...`) and Primary Client ownership for Related Person billing; retained Phase 2 CSRF mechanism selection and validation as an explicit task.
- Activated Phase 1 and completed Task F1-01 (Repository and dependency baseline) by creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, fixing flake8/black configs and lint errors, and verifying django baseline.
