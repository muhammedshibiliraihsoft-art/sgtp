# Security

## Current starter state

The cloned starter contains partial security scaffolding: a custom email-based User, Django/DRF authentication, SimpleJWT access/refresh endpoints, session middleware, CSRF middleware, security middleware, CORS middleware, soft-delete/audit base-model fields, and production security settings. These controls are incomplete and have not established the full SGTP V1 security architecture.

Known starter gaps included incomplete tenant membership/isolation, missing object-level authorization, an uninstalled SimpleJWT blacklist app, and incomplete host/CORS configuration. The host/CORS configuration and JWT blacklist app have been resolved in Phase 1 (F1-02). A control must not be treated as complete merely because a related dependency or middleware is present.

## Target V1 security architecture

The target security architecture will be built and verified by the implementation phases. It includes secure access/refresh-token handling with an HttpOnly/Secure refresh cookie, rotation and reuse detection, an approved CSRF strategy for cookie-authenticated state-changing requests, supplier/shop isolation, object-level permissions, secure private object storage, audit logging, rate limiting, safe errors, monitoring, and security testing. The complete target architecture does not yet exist in code.

## Future review areas

- Secret and environment-variable handling
- Authentication, authorization, and tenant isolation
- CSRF, session, cookie, and security-header configuration
- Input validation, output encoding, and file-upload handling
- Dependency and supply-chain controls
- Database access and backups
- Logging, privacy, and incident response

Do not claim a control is enabled until it is implemented and verified.
